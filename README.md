# Welcome to the GRWM chatbot! ğŸ’„âœ¨
Your go-to bestie for all things makeup, skincare, outfits, and glow-up tips ğŸ’… Our project is inspired by Y2K desktop aesthetics, bringing you nostalgic memories with retro vibes. Our navbar is designed to look like icons on a desktop, and we implemented a Windows theme!

## **How to use:**
**Home** -> Takes you to the landing page. Click *Get Started* to go to the chatbot! \n
**Chatbot** -> You can also click the button on the "desktop" to jump back to the chatbot page quickly. \n
**About** -> Click here to learn more about the project and the team! \n
**Github** -> View the source code (Opens in a new tab) \n

Simply type in the chatbot and hit send to start chatting!
(*Note: The chatbot is currently not functional due to OpenAI key restrictions on public repos, however it is something we'd like to work on finding a solution in the future. Please see the YouTube video here -> (insert link) to see the bot in action!*)

Have fun styling, girlies! ğŸ’–ğŸ«¶
